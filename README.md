# <Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This is a test website build that the prework has walked me through so that I can get a head start on the bootcamp work to come. The idea is to have a place to keep track of notes, while also actively learning by doing. The idea was to get introduced to a few coding languages, as well as the GitHun workflow.

## Usage

Honestly, this website is meant for my own use. It was just a trial to see if code would work, and the idea was to record some of the notes that were more relevant to the different sections in the pre-work course. It is not comprehensive. There is also some JavaScript in the DevTools console that can randomly suggest a topic to explore first.
